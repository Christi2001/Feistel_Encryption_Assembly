# Feistel_Encryption_Assembly
This was a university coursework on writing complex low-level code, namely a working Feistel cipher program that takes plaintext and outputs ciphertext.
It contains an HDL version (the .hdl file) along with a HACK Assembly version (the .asm file) of the implementation, plus code for testing and comparing the output.

DISCLAIMER: the .tst file is NOT written by me - full credits go to the module leader of module COMP1212 Computer Processors at the Univeristy of Leeds.
